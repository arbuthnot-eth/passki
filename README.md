> **Rebranded April 2026.** Formerly `.SKI` / `sui.ski`. The npm package, GitHub repo, and primary domain are now `passki`. The legacy domain `sui.ski` still routes to the same worker as an alias. Internal lore ("SKI Pass", "key-in", Pokemon versioning) is unchanged — SKI is still the in-project shorthand for the sign-in primitive.

## What passki Is

passki is a Sui-native messaging and cross-chain identity dApp where SuiNS names are communication endpoints. You send a thunder to `@name` and it lands as an encrypted storm conversation whose ciphertext lives on Walrus and whose keys live behind Seal. Every wallet, agent, and cross-chain address is IKA-native — no private keys sit on Cloudflare Workers, ever. The same UI rails carry Thunder messages, Thunder IOU transfers, shielded Pedersen commitments, Shade grace-period snipes, and SUIAMI cross-chain identity proofs.

Agents (ultron, chronicoms, t2000s) are Durable Objects that sign via IKA dWallet user shares + DWalletCap wrappers. `brando.sui` runs DKG in the browser and re-encrypts the user share to the agent. Either brando OR agent + IKA network = a valid signature.

## For Hackathon Devs (Frontier Colosseum)

SKI is the best IKA-based Web2 social login experience you can build with today. Here's what you get out of the box:

### WaaP — Wallet as a Protocol
Sign in with **X.com, Google, phone, or email**. No API keys. No seed phrases. No wallet extensions. It just works. If you're a dev, you know how amazing "no API keys" is.

### Rumble Your Squids
One button runs IKA DKG and provisions **native Bitcoin, Solana, and EVM dWallet addresses** — all from a single Sui account. Not wrapped. Not bridged. Real cross-chain keys. This is built and live on mainnet today.

### Anti-Spam — Stables Only
SKI is inherently anti-spam. Everything is measured in **stables**. You have 8 billion MONKE PENIS coins? SKI checks all exchanges, sees it's worth less than a cent, and filters it out — or auto-swaps it to USD (or Argentine Peso). No more `0.000256 CHODE` in your portfolio.

### Subcent Intents
The 6-7 digits after `$0.01` aren't noise — they're **steganographic intent tags**:
- Which chain are you swapping to?
- What is the receiving address?
- Other privately encoded data only legible to the participants

One number carries the instruction. No metadata leaks.

### What You Can Build With
- **Tradeport** — SuiNS marketplace listing proxy (`/api/tradeport/listing/:label`)
- **Walrus** — Seal-encrypted blob storage for Thunder ciphertext, Shade payloads, quilted batch writes
- **Solana/Helius** — Webhook-driven deposit watchers, SPL token resolution, Jupiter routing
- **Seal** — 2-of-3 threshold encryption (Overclock, Studio Mirai, H2O Nodes key servers)
- **IKA dWallets** — Native cross-chain signing, batch DKG, DWalletCap wrappers

## Native Cross-Chain Wallets via IKA dWallets

Real Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana addresses controlled by your Sui account — no bridges, no wrapping, no custodians. Powered by [IKA](https://docs.ika.xyz)'s 2PC-MPC threshold signatures.

### What One Sui Account Controls

| Curve | Chains | Address Format |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **secp256k1** (1 DKG) | Bitcoin, Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Tron (USDT only) | `bc1q...`, `0x...`, `T...` |
| **ed25519** (1 DKG) | Solana | base58 |

Two DKG ceremonies. Two dWallets. Eight chains. One Sui account.

### Why This Matters

- **No bridges** — BTC stays on Bitcoin, SOL stays on Solana. IKA generates real native addresses whose signing is governed by Sui smart contracts.
- **Non-collusive security** — 2PC-MPC means neither the user nor the network can sign alone. 100+ mainnet operators with Byzantine threshold.
- **Quantum-ready architecture** — Sui's flag-byte signature scheme lets the network add post-quantum primitives via a new flag byte — no hard fork, no address migration. See [`docs/ika-quantum-resistance.md`](docs/ika-quantum-resistance.md).

---

## First Commandment: IKA-Native, Keyless Agents

- **Every wallet, agent, and cross-chain address MUST be IKA-native.**
- **No private keys on Cloudflare Workers — ever.** Agents sign via IKA dWallet user shares + DWalletCap wrapper.
- Cross-chain addresses (BTC, ETH, SOL) come from IKA dWallet DKG — always. No raw keypair re-encoding as cross-chain addresses.
- `brando.sui` runs DKG in-browser, re-encrypts user share to the agent. Either brando OR agent + IKA network = valid signature.
- Batch DKG provisioning for agents = "Rumble your squids."
- If a dWallet doesn't exist yet, the feature is blocked until DKG is run — no shortcuts.

## Magneton — Sealed Messaging Through a Keyless Blind Relay

Magneton is SKI's sealed messaging layer. One sentence, canonical:

> **A Prismoid opens a storm with its squids. Each thunder — and each prism — is scribed by ultron into both Prismoids' chronicoms, the chronicoms write through to the timestream, and sibyl reads the timestream to score trust — turning strangers into inkas as each carries the other's suiami.**

- **Prismoid** — your identity vessel. A Move object wrapping one or more IKA dWallets that carries your SuiNS name and every cross-chain address you can touch. Transfer one object, transfer the whole identity atomically.
- **Squid** — a single chain-capable appendage of a Prismoid. One per curve: secp256k1 squid reaches BTC/EVM, ed25519 squid reaches SOL/Sui. Multiple squids can cooperate on cross-chain multi-sig. "Rumble your squids" provisions them in a single DKG ceremony.
- **Opening** — the first squid-sign between two Prismoids that opens a storm. Scribed into both chronicoms as the anchor of the relationship. The squid used matches the recipient's native chain, so the anchor is verifiable from any chain the recipient cares about.
- **Scribe** — the verb. Ultron *scribes* each thunder *and* each prism into both Prismoids' chronicoms. The chronicoms write through to the timestream. One unified pipeline for messages and transactions.
- **Inscribe** — the opt-in non-repudiable variant. To *inscribe* a thunder or prism = attach a squid signature so the entry is permanently third-party verifiable in the timestream. Default is deniable; flip to inscribed when you want proof. Signal cannot do this for messages; suiami can do it for messages *and* transactions, in one substrate.
- **Chronicom** — your per-Prismoid Durable Object. Holds the suiamis you carry (your inka set), every storm you participate in, and every prism you exchange. The chronicom is your local view; the timestream is the authoritative one.
- **Timestream** — the temporal substrate every chronicom writes through to. The on-chain time-ordered ledger of all scribed entries — both thunders and prisms — between Prismoids.
- **Sibyl** — the oracle. Reads the timestream to score trust, predict spam, and signal inka eligibility.
- **inka / inkas vs strangers** — an inka is **someone whose suiami you carry**. The moment your chronicom holds another Prismoid's SUI-AUTH-MSG-ID credential, they're an inka. Strangers are anyone whose suiami you don't carry. Country-pool inkas (everyone with a Full SKI Pass in your country) are auto-shared by ultron at key-in time; cross-country inkas are earned through scribed thunders or sent prisms.
- **suiami** — **SUI-AUTH-MSG-ID.** The authenticated message-identity credential — a tamper-evident proof of ownership of a Prismoid + its SuiNS name + its squids, stamped with country metadata at minting time. Published as the [`suiami` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suiami).
- **SKI Pass** — a roster of credentials per SuiNS name (NFT + squids), bound by the name, auto-minted on first key-in, country-attested. Comes in two tiers: Full (default for primary country) and Temporary (any new country until upgraded by either multiple key-ins over time or by sending a Prism worth a threshold to ultron). No expiry unless you don't key in for 3 years.

### The topology: Thunder through ultron

Every thunder is a **double envelope**. The outer envelope is encrypted to ultron and contains only `{ recipient_prismoid, inner_ciphertext }`. The inner envelope is encrypted to the recipient's squid. Ultron routes the inner envelope but **cannot read it** — it is a **keyless blind relay**. It knows who talks to who; it does not know what they say. First commandment holds: no private keys on Cloudflare Workers, ever.

Thunder isn't a performance compromise — it's the decision that unlocks everything downstream:

| Layer | What Thunder unlocks |
|---|---|
| **Spam control (inkas vs strangers)** | Enforcement lives at ultron, not in N client implementations. Visiting sui.ski and keying in mints a SKI Pass automatically — that's the gate. Strangers to SKI fix it in 10 seconds; inkas (anyone whose suiami you carry) pass through. Zero client trust needed. |
| **Delivery model** | One WebSocket per Prismoid to ultron, reused for all traffic. Cloudflare Durable Object hibernatable WebSockets are free when idle. Already wired. |
| **Forward secrecy** | Single write path. Ultron watches Prismoid rotation events on-chain and scribes new anchors into the timestream. No multi-device desync — the anchor lives in the chronicom where both sides read from it. |
| **Cross-chain delivery** | Collapses into "ultron emits chain-specific notifications." Ultron has its own dWallets (ed25519, secp256k1) and can drop a SOL memo, an EVM event, or a BTC OP_RETURN when the recipient has no SKI client. The non-Sui recipient installs nothing. |
| **Magnezone evolution** | Uniform traffic is the *precondition* for onion mixing and cover traffic. Thunder is what makes the mixnet path possible later. |

The alternative — direct peer-to-peer — would leak your entire social graph to any passive observer, force every client to enforce its own spam rules, break cross-chain delivery, and close the door on mixnet evolution forever. Hybrid (direct for inkas, ultron for strangers) doubles the codebase, bifurcates enforcement, and kills mixing. The "latency win" from direct is tens of milliseconds. Not worth it.

Thunder. Ultron sees who, never what. Everything else falls out for free.

## Terminology

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Storm** | A conversation (not channel/group) |
| **Thunder** | A message or signal |
| **Quest** | The act of reading/opening |
| **Purge** | Delete-on-read (never "decrypt") |
| **Cache** | Fund storage (never "treasury/reserve/dao") |
| **Rumble** | IKA DKG ceremony (never multi-token swap routing) |
| **SKI Pass** | Access/membership proof |
| **Stables** | Dollar-pegged value (never "stablecoins") |
| **Sibyl** | The predictor (never "Sybil") |
| **chain@name** | Address format: `sol@ultron`, `eth@brando`, `btc@stables` |
| **encrypt / decrypt** | Always verb forms, never "encrypted/encryption" |

## Core Principles

- **IKA-native, keyless agents.** Every cross-chain address is IKA dWallet derived. No private keys on workers. Batch DKG = "Rumble your squids."
- **Cache, not treasury.** Funds flow through caches — high-performance temporary stores.
- **Stables, not stablecoins.** iUSD is a stable backed by activity yield.
- **Encrypt, not encrypted.** Use verb forms — encrypt/decrypt.

## Domain Structure

| Domain | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `passki.xyz` | Root — main application, embeddable widget, API endpoints (custom domain on `dotski` worker) |
| `www.passki.xyz` | Apex alias (custom domain, same worker) |
| `sui.ski` | Legacy alias — still routed to `dotski` for backward compatibility |
| `<name>.sui.ski` | SuiNS profile pages (e.g. `brando.sui.ski`) — preserved for existing links |

Cross-domain session cookie (`ski:xdomain`) on `domain=sui.ski` for auth persistence across legacy subdomains. A parallel cookie on `passki.xyz` is registered alongside.

---

## UI Overview

The `.SKI` header bar renders four elements:

- **Dot** — wallet status shape (green circle = unconnected, black diamond = connected, blue square = has SuiNS name). Toggles modal/menu.
- **Profile pill** — wallet icon, social badge, SuiNS name + squid emoji (IKA status), live balance. Clicks to `.sui.ski` profile page.
- **SKI button** — branded button. Three-state cycle: menu → idle overlay → menu.
- **Balance pill** — live USD balance. Click to cycle SUI/USD display.

### Idle Overlay

After 5 minutes of inactivity (or via SKI button cycle), the menu collapses into a compact overlay with:
- Pixel art video (cached via Cache API for instant replay)
- Name search input with full SuiNS resolution
- Squids rows — styled SUI/BTC/SOL/ETH/Base/Tron address rows with chain-colored icons, per-row USD balances, toggle-select to copy
- Rumble button — runs IKA DKG to provision all chain wallets
- Thunder messaging row
- Version badge linking to npm

The overlay restores instantly on hard refresh via `ski:last-address` localStorage fallback, with IKA addresses cached to `ski:ika-addrs:${address}`.

### Squids Panel — Cross-Chain Balance Display

Clicking the 🦑 squid quick-action opens the **squids panel**, the idle-overlay view of every chain the user's IKA dWallet derives. Each row shows the chain glyph, truncated address, and live USD balance:

- **SUI** — native + stables via gRPC `listBalances` (Mysten fullnode)
- **BTC** — native via mempool.space `/api/address/<addr>` (free, key-less)
- **SOL** — native + iUSD-SPL via Helius `/api/sol-rpc` proxy (`getBalance` + `getTokenAccountsByOwner`)
- **ETH (mainnet)** — native + USDC ERC-20 via **viem** + Alchemy HTTPS transport (`ALCHEMY_ETH_URL` secret, `eth_getBalance` + `erc20Abi.balanceOf`)
- **TRON** — USDT-TRC20 via TronGrid `/v1/accounts/<addr>` (free tier)

Derived addresses come from the IKA dWallet `public_output` — even dWallets stuck in `AwaitingKeyHolderSignature` produce valid BCS-derived addresses, so users see their cross-chain identity the moment DKG starts instead of waiting for the accept-share step. Balances roll into the single `app.usd` total alongside Sui and stables so the header balance pill is a true net-worth aggregate across every chain brando holds.

**QR top slot** — above the chain rows, a chain-colored QR code with the selected chain's logo inlaid (green `$` for SUI, orange `₿` for BTC, official Solana parallelograms for SOL, indigo `Ξ` for ETH, red Tron triangles for TRON). Clicking a chain row updates the QR + highlights the row in its chain color; clicking the QR expands it to 260×260. Hovering a row swaps the truncated hex for the identity form (`brando.sui` / `btc@brando` / `sol@brando` / `eth@brando` / `tron@brando`) while the native `title` tooltip shows the full hex — both visible simultaneously.

### SKI Modal

Single-column overlay with key detail pane, Splash legend (keys grouped by shape tier), wallet list, and WaaP social login row. Long-press lock (2.2s) pins a wallet. Layout toggle persists preference.

### SKI Menu

Dropdown with SuiNS name management, marketplace purchase (Tradeport/kiosk), Shade orders, Thunder messaging, coin chip swaps, SUIAMI identity proofs, and key management.

## Thunder — Seal-Encrypted Messaging

Thunder is a thin wrapper around [`@mysten/sui-stack-messaging`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-stack-messaging) with a custom Cloudflare Durable Object relayer (`TimestreamAgent`).

- **Encryption** — Seal 2-of-3 threshold DEK + AES-GCM envelope. Relayer never sees plaintext. Key servers verified on first encrypt (`verifyKeyServers: true`).
- **Transport** — `TimestreamAgent` DO, one instance per `groupId`, speaks HTTP to `/api/timestream/:groupId/:action` (`send`, `fetch`, `fetch-one`, `update`, `delete`, `add-participant`).
- **Identity** — SuiNS names (`alice.sui`) resolved via SuinsClient to target address / NFT owner.
- **Storm** — on-chain `PermissionedGroup<Messaging>` (upstream Move package) anchors key-version history and membership; messages live off-chain in the DO.
- **Global SUIAMI Storm** — `0xfe23aad02ff15935b09249b4c5369bcd85f02ce157f54f94a3e7cc6dfa10a6e8` (uuid `suiami-global`), public identity directory. Joining is a public act by design.
- **Seal servers** — Overclock, Studio Mirai, H2O Nodes (mainnet, open/free). 2-of-3 threshold.

### Privacy Phase 1 (2026-04-10)

- **No plaintext fallback** — `encryptWithRetry` retries up to 5× and fails the send rather than storing cleartext. Transfer notes also encrypted.
- **Message padding** — plaintext padded to fixed buckets `[256, 1024, 4096, 16384]` bytes before Seal, killing the ciphertext-length side channel.
- **Timestamp jitter** — DO rounds `createdAt`/`updatedAt` to 10s buckets + ±5s noise on ingest. Monotonic `order` preserves UI sort.
- **Sender index on the wire** — new messages store `senderIndex` (position in the DO's participant list) instead of the raw Sui address. A dump of `messages` no longer reveals who authored what.
- **Attachment guard** — DO rejects `attachments: [...]` at the send boundary; our transport does not round-trip them, and silently accepting would leak blob IDs outside the Seal envelope.

### Thunder Attachments (Regizapdos #147)

Full attachment support lands via `@mysten/sui-stack-messaging` — Seal-encrypted per file, uploaded to Walrus via the configured HTTP publisher, decrypted on click via the SDK's `handle.data()`. All three main send paths (`iUSD transfer`, `SUI shielded transfer`, plain text send) wire `files: AttachmentFile[]` through `sendThunder`. Ancillary paths (read receipts, quick-reply) deliberately don't carry attachments.

**Cache hydration** — `_ThunderEntry` in the stale-while-revalidate localStorage cache preserves attachment refs (`storageId`, `fileName`, `mimeType`, `fileSize`) so reopened storms paint chips/thumbs immediately instead of flashing text-only. Bytes stay in Walrus; only refs cross the localStorage boundary. The AES-GCM key in IndexedDB stays non-extractable.

**Size limits** (aligned with SDK enforcement):
- Per-file: **2 MB** (was 10 MB UI-side, SDK always enforced 2 MB)
- Per message: **4 files** (was 10 UI-side)
- Total per message: **5 MB** (new pre-upload guard — 4×2 MB silent failures now caught at attach time)

Errors fire as UI toasts before the SDK rejects. Walrus upload failures fail the whole send cleanly — no silent text orphaning. WaaP attachment path verification is deferred (needs live repro).

Remaining Phase 2 items (sealed sender, non-derivable group IDs, encrypted membership) are deferred — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-10-thunder-privacy-audit-and-roadmap.md`.

### Thunder IOU + Thunder IOU Shielded

Thunder carries value as well as text. A `$amount` in a thunder composes a token transfer into the same PTB as the signal.

- **Thunder IOU** — plain escrowed transfers with recall + expiry. Package: `0x5a80b9753d6ccce11dc1f9a5039d9430d3e43a216f82f957ef11df9cb5c4dc79`.
- **Thunder IOU Shielded** — BLS12-381 Pedersen commitment transfers. Amounts are hidden on-chain; the recipient decrypts a sealed opening via Seal and reveals via a zero-knowledge verification in Move. Package: `0x3b1dcced3f585157f48afd14a84f42e65ee57dd38be9dd73d7d94a0a1b690782`.
- **Dust gate** — sub-cent sends bypass the shielded path (per `Diglett Lv.18`) and route to plain IOU.
- **Batching** — `buildShieldedDepositManyTx` (Dugtrio Lv.36) and the in-flight Mr. Rime Lv.52 aggregate-vault evolution batch multiple deposits in one PTB.

Active IOU work in the Pokedex covers the activate/redeem UI (Pikachu), iUSD-yield escrow (Typhlosion), iUSD gas (Ampharos), Seal-encrypted `sealed_memo` (Magnezone), multi-token `Iou<T>` (Garchomp), and the IKA cross-chain activate to ETH/SOL/BTC (Metagross).

### Gas-Free Stables Everywhere

Thunder sends work with **zero SUI** in the sender's wallet:

- **iUSD-native transfers** — when the sender lacks SUI, the send routes through `iusdTransfer` (plain `transferObjects` of iUSD coins). Gas is either ultron-sponsored (non-WaaP) or covered by a 0.1 SUI drip from ultron (WaaP).
- **iUSD→USDC→SUI two-hop swap** — `buildSwapTx` chains the seeded iUSD/USDC DeepBook pool with the main SUI/USDC pool. Slippage protection at 90% minimum output; liquidity pre-check rejects swaps exceeding pool depth.
- **iUSD→USDC→NS registration** — `buildIusdSwap` path in `buildRegisterSplashNsTx` swaps iUSD through both pools and registers a SuiNS name with the NS-discounted path. One signature.
- **Tradeport iUSD-redeem** — `/api/infer` detects iUSD holders and routes marketplace buys through ultron pre-fund (SUI advanced, user repays in iUSD+USDC). Tightened accounting: Pyth price passed from infer to DO, gas buffer + 0.5% safety margin charged to the buyer.
- **TTL reduction** — `IOU_DEFAULT_TTL_MS` reduced from 7 days to 10 minutes. The `iou-sweeper` cron (every 10 min) auto-recalls expired vaults permissionlessly via ultron.

### SUIAMI Batch Claim/Recall

The Storm action button turns green **SUIAMI** when unclaimed transfer vaults exist in the current conversation. One click builds a batch PTB with `claim` or `recall` per vault and signs in one tx. Settled transfers collapse into a single gray summary line showing net amounts and tx count.

The ↩ button on the quick-amount chip row scans ALL `ShieldedVault` objects on-chain where the connected wallet is the sender, and batch-recalls them.

### Shade v5 — Generic Stable Deposits

Shade contract upgraded to v5 (`0x9978db0a...`) with `create_stable<T>`, `execute_stable<T>`, `cancel_stable<T>`. Shade deposits can now be denominated in **any coin type** (iUSD, USDC, etc.) — no SUI required. UpgradeCap owned by `plankton.sui`, policy 0 (compatible).

### SOL → Shade Pipeline

One-scan cross-chain shade placement:

1. Type a grace-period name → Solana QR appears (centered, large, Solana logo) on the idle overlay
2. Scan with Phantom/Solflare → send SOL to `sol@ultron`
3. SOL watcher detects deposit (route=3, shade intent) → attests SOL collateral → mints iUSD to ultron
4. Auto-fires `_shadeProxy` → `create_stable<IUSD>` → shade order placed with iUSD deposit
5. At grace expiry → `execute_stable<IUSD>` → name registers to the depositor's Sui address

Zero SUI. Zero clicks after the scan. SOL value teleports cross-chain via iUSD synthetic accounting.

### iUSD/USDC DeepBook Pool

Pool `0x38df72f5...` seeded via `seedIusdPoolV3` — one atomic PTB: create shared BalanceManager, deposit all iUSD+USDC, place ASK @ 1.01 + BID @ 0.99, share BM. Current package dispatch uses `0x337f4f4f...` (latest DeepBook mainnet), not the origin package.

## SUIAMI

SUI-Authenticated Message Identity — cryptographic proof that a SuiNS name belongs to you. Verified server-side via `/api/suiami/verify`.

### SUIAMI Roster

Cross-chain identity resolver. Maps SuiNS names to BTC/ETH/SOL addresses via IKA dWallets in a shared on-chain registry with reverse lookup.

**v2 Package:** `0xef4fa3fa12a1413cf998ea8b03348281bb9edd09f21a0a245a42b103a2e9c3b4`

### SUIAMI Reciprocal Roster

Seal-encrypted cross-chain identity exchange. No cleartext cross-chain addresses ever appear on-chain — only the SUI address (already public) and a Walrus blob ID.

**How it works:**
1. User proves SUIAMI ownership (signed message + SuiNS NFT verification)
2. Cross-chain addresses (BTC/ETH/SOL) are AES-GCM encrypted and uploaded to Walrus as a blob
3. Only the blob ID is written to the on-chain roster — no cleartext addresses on-chain
4. Decryption is Storm-gated via Seal policy (`seal_approve_roster_reader`): you must hold a valid SUIAMI proof to decrypt anyone's addresses
5. **Reciprocal:** reading someone's roster entry requires your own SUIAMI proof, which auto-writes your entry if it doesn't exist yet
6. **Viral:** every lookup adds a new roster entry, growing the network organically

**Contracts:**
- Roster Package: `0x2c1d63b3b314f9b6e96c33e9a3bca4faaa79a69a5729e5d2e8ac09d70e1052fa`
- Roster Object: `0x30b45c51a34b20b5ab99e8c493a82c332e9502e5f4380d1be6cc79e712eaab1d`
- Seal Policy: `seal_approve_roster_reader`

**npm:** [`suiami@0.2.0`](https://github.com/arbuthnot-eth/SUIAMI)

**Key files:**
- `contracts/suiami/sources/roster.move` — on-chain roster contract
- `contracts/suiami/sources/seal_roster.move` — Seal decryption policy
- `src/client/roster.ts` — Walrus blob upload/fetch with AES-GCM encryption
- `src/suins.ts` — `readRosterByAddress`, `maybeAppendRoster`
- `scripts/deploy-suiami-storm.ts` — one-time global Storm deployment

## Mega Sableye — Private Interaction Set (#148)

Roster chips render with a **black diamond** glyph for names brando has privately interacted with (Thunder send, value transfer, cross-chain credit). The set lives as **AES-GCM ciphertext** in the user's Chronicom Durable Object — the operator only ever sees the opaque blob, and the wrapping key is a **non-extractable** `CryptoKey` persisted in browser IndexedDB so raw key material never leaves the device.

**Client — `src/client/sableye.ts`:**
- `warmSableye(addr)` — fetch ciphertext from Chronicom, AES-GCM decrypt into in-memory `Set<string>`
- `noteCounterparty(name, chain)` — add + debounce 2s persist back to Chronicom
- `hasSableye(name)` — synchronous lookup for render loops (`_renderRosterChip` calls this)
- `drainXchainLog()` — pulls any server-side webhook touches and processes them through `reverseLookupName`
- `flushSableye()` / `resetSableye()` — lifecycle

**Chronicom DO slice — `src/server/agents/chronicom.ts`:**
- `sableye: { cipher?: string; updatedAt?: number; xchainLog?: [...] }`
- Rejects non-string cipher at the write boundary; DO inspection yields only ciphertext
- Worker routes `GET/POST /api/chronicom/sableye?addr=<address>`

**Event hooks (minimal resource impact):**
- **Thunder** — `sendThunder` in `thunder-stack.ts` dispatches `ski:thunder-sent` with the recipient name; ui records the counterparty on every send
- **Cross-chain** — Helius + Alchemy webhook handlers append to `sableye.xchainLog` via an internal `/sableye-xchain-append` DO route (rides nursery PR #132 — depends on webhook handlers not yet on master)
- **Roster render** — `_renderRosterChip` consults `hasSableye(bareName)` synchronously; black diamond on hit, blue square on miss

See issue #145, PR #148.

## Shade

Privacy-preserving SuiNS grace-period domain sniping. Commitment-reveal hides domain/target/timing on-chain until execution. Seal encryption for payload privacy.

- **ShadeExecutorAgent** — Cloudflare DO auto-executes at grace expiry via alarms
- **`execute()`** — permissionless; anyone with the preimage can call
- Three routes: SUI→NS, SUI→USDC→NS, SUI direct fallback

**Contract:** `0xfcd0b2b4f69758cd3ed0d35a55335417cac6304017c3c5d9a5aaff75c367aaff`

See [SHIELD.md](SHIELD.md) for the security model.

## OpenCLOB — Cross-Chain Order Book

Phase 3a is live: the `thunder_openclob::bundle` Move package is published and the `treasury-agents` scanner watches bundles over GraphQL. Sub-cent steganographic tags act as order-matching keys. Phase 3b adds a client-side bundle builder (merged) and a keeper settlement path (in-flight).

**Package:** `0xdcbabe3d80cd9b421113f66f2a1287daa8259f5c02861c33e7cc92fc542af0d7`

## Pokemon Swarm

.SKI runs a Pokedex coordinator Durable Object that watches GitHub issues, branches, and PRs as a live swarm. Per the naming convention: legendary Pokemon are releases, regular Pokemon with level tags are commits and issues, merged PRs are evolutions (canon forms first — Mega, Gigantamax — otherwise Pokemon Infinite Fusion cross-species forms). Recent evolutions include:

- **Silvally RKS** (#192) — IKA dWallet + Move policy for delegated subname issuance. Load-bearing for SuiNS Crowds.
- **Machamp** (#193) — Fighting trainer driving the Silvally de-risking spike. Focus Punch → Bulk Up → Cross Chop → Agility → Close Combat (9/9 Move tests passing).
- **Klinklang Gear Grind** (#191) — Steel Jacket shipped, first jacket composing on Silvally base. Auto-prune-on-expiry via Mysten #356.
- **Mega Sableye** (#148) — Seal-encrypted private interaction set; black-diamond roster glyphs; Chronicom ciphertext slice
- **Regizapdos** (#147, Zapdos × Registeel fusion) — Thunder attachment hardening; cache hydration of attachment refs; SDK-aligned size limits (2 MB/file, 4 files, 5 MB total)
- **Raichu Lv.40** — ultron-sponsored thunder gas
- **Mr. Mime Lv.42** — shielded Pedersen transfers
- **Alakazam Lv.36** — forward secrecy via DEK rotation
- **Psyduck Lv.22** — collected-pill fix
- **Diglett Lv.18** — dust gate
- **Dugtrio Lv.36** — batched shielded deposits

**gitcatch** — the full commit → evolve → deploy cycle. `gitcatch Pokemon` commits outstanding moves as Pokemon-named commits, lands the PR as an evolution (canon Mega / Gigantamax first, then Infinite Fusion cross-species naming), and deploys to mainnet. Memory: `feedback_gitcatch.md`.

The Pokedex DO is bound as `PokedexAgent` and exposes `/api/pokedex/*` routes. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-11-pokemon-swarm-agents.md`.

## SuiNS Crowds — Silvally + Jackets (Vercel Buenos Aires, 2026-04-24)

**Crowds** is SKI's delegated-subname primitive — what SuiNS Communities, ENS subnames, DNS, and Unstoppable Domains collectively failed to ship. A single SuiNS name becomes a chartered on-chain body whose members hold bounded, time-locked, revocable caps to mint subnames under it. Built for the Vercel Buenos Aires hackathon on 2026-04-24 and landing as a son PR atop [MystenLabs/suins-contracts#364](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suins-contracts/pull/364).

### Silvally RKS — IKA dWallet with subname-creation policy

The load-bearing primitive. An IKA dWallet owns the `SuinsRegistration` NFT via a Move policy object (`ski::dwallet_subname_policy::SubnamePolicy`). The policy's typed entry functions are the only path to `coordinator::approve_message`, and IKA's `request_sign` refuses to sign without a `MessageApproval`. That makes the `DWalletCap` held inside a shared Move object the canonical signing authority — content-aware signing via the Move object graph, not via an IKA protocol feature.

Owner retains all rights through the `OwnerCap` path. Delegates get a quota- and expiration-bounded `delegate_approve_spike` path. First Commandment holds: no private keys anywhere, no user-wallet custody transfer.

**Status:** scaffold in `contracts/silvally/`, 9/9 Move unit tests passing, real-IKA signatures pulled from `@ika.xyz/sdk@0.3.1` generated BCS. Runtime-spike on mainnet is the one remaining unknown — publish + Rumble + `delegate_approve_spike` → `request_sign` runbook at `contracts/silvally/PRESS_GO.md`. See `scripts/silvally-press-go.ts` for the one-shot helper (`--publish` / `--rumble` / `--spike`).

### Jackets — composable variants over the base

Jackets are SKI's composition primitive for extending `SubnamePolicy`. The base module exposes `public(package)` hooks like `reclaim_quota` that only sibling jacket modules in the `ski` package can call, so external callers can't forge policy-side state changes. Each jacket attaches via the policy's `OwnerCap` and gates its own admin ops through a jacket-specific capability.

| Jacket | Pokemon | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Steel | Klinklang Gear Grind (#191) | Auto-prune-on-expiry via [MystenLabs/suins-contracts#356](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suins-contracts/pull/356). Records prune events, reclaims quota slots. **Shipped in `ski::steel_jacket`.** |
| Fire | Garchomp Dragon Rush (#175) | Hackathon-burst issuance, rate-limited |
| Ghost | Lunala Moongeist (#173) | Seal-gated issuance, opaque roster |
| Electric | Magnezone Magnet Rise (#189) | Cross-crowd alliance issuance via `getAgentByName` |
| Water | Suicune Aurora Beam (#174) | Auto-Roster cross-chain registration on each issue |
| Psychic | Cresselia Lunar Ballot (#180) | Issuance gated by Seal-encrypted member quorum |

### Upstream status

- **[suins-contracts#356](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suins-contracts/pull/356)** — Prune expired subdomains by parent authority. **Merged 2026-04-17.** Enables every timelocked-ticket pattern in the Crowds arc.
- **[suins-contracts#364](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suins-contracts/pull/364)** — SubnameCap delegation. Open. Silvally decouples Crowds from its merge — our `dwallet_subname_policy` module doesn't wait on upstream review. When #364 lands, jackets migrate to mint native `SubnameCap` objects.

### Pokemon evolution line for the arc

Parent pitches: `#172 Solgaleo` (flagship daylight) · `#173 Lunala` (sealed shadow) · `#174 Suicune` (cross-chain flow) · `#175 Garchomp` (5-min stage demo) · `#176 Metagross` (four-brain architecture). 14 move sub-issues (#177–#191). `#192 Silvally RKS` is the unlock; `#193 Machamp` is the Fighting trainer driving the spike through Focus Punch → Bulk Up → Cross Chop → Agility → Close Combat.

## Upcoming — Ghost Line for Colosseum Frontier

Active in-flight work for the Ika + Encrypt side track of Colosseum Frontier. Submission deadline approximately 2026-05-11; side-track prize pool $15K USDC via Superteam Earn, main track $2.5M+.

Thesis: native Ika dWallets on Solana plus Encrypt FHE claim logic equals bridgeless and encrypted capital markets on Solana, extending the existing Thunder and Storm UX to cross-chain. We keep the same storm → thunder → claim shell users already know, and swap the substrate to Ika pre-alpha on Solana (`solana-pre-alpha.ika.xyz`) and Encrypt (`docs.encrypt.xyz`).

Ghost line issues:

- **#101 Gastly Lv.20** — Solana redeem UI scaffold (stage 1)
- **#102 Haunter Lv.40** — Sui-side claim + swap + burn + poltergeist keeper pickup (stage 2)
- **#103 Gengar Lv.55** — feature-complete Solana redeem for encrypt.xyz Colosseum (stage 3)
- **#104 Shelgon Lv.45** — shadow-DKG provisioning; keeper runs DKG alone, user share encrypted to recipient pubkey
- **#105 Salamence Lv.65** — user reclaims shadow dWallet on first login

Demo target: a judge opens a phone at the Colosseum stage, receives a live \$5 thunder, claims it as native USDC-SPL on `sol@name`, and sees it land in Phantom within 30 seconds. Zero bridges. The amount is never visible on-chain until claim execution inside an Encrypt FHE function. The Solana-side dWallet is provisioned on-demand via Ika.

## Sibyl — The Predictor

Custom oracle. Timestreams flow price through time. Pythia (ultron.sui) channels visions. Offerings flow to the iUSD cache. Sibyl's Court: Anthropologists (research), Hunters (iUSD yield), Rogues (IKA squid breeding).

## ultron.sui — Autonomous Agent

Thunder uses the upstream [`@mysten/sui-stack-messaging`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-stack-messaging) Move package; no custom Thunder or Storm contract. An earlier hybrid-stack package (`0xa3ed4fdf...cdf942`) was published but never wired into the client and has been stripped from the source tree.

}));

window.addEventListener('ski:transaction-result', (e: CustomEvent) => {
  const { requestId, success, digest, error } = e.detail;
});
```

Splash sponsorship is applied automatically when active.

## Self-Hosting

```bash
bun install
npx wrangler login
bun run build && npx wrangler deploy
```

Never skip the deploy step. Never use `bun run deploy` — only `npx wrangler deploy`. Two workers back the app: `dotski` (agents, treasury, messaging DOs) and `sui-ski` (subnames, auth).

### Durable Objects

| Binding | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SessionAgent` | Signed session verification |
| `SponsorAgent` | Splash sponsor state |
| `SplashDeviceAgent` | Per-device Splash activation |
| `ShadeExecutorAgent` | Auto-executes Shade orders at grace expiry |
| `TreasuryAgents` | ultron.sui — iUSD minting, collateral, NS acquisition, Thunder relay |
| `Chronicom` | Per-wallet thunder signal watcher with cached counts |
| `TimestreamAgent` | Per-group Thunder message storage (Seal-encrypted, one DO per `groupId`) |

### API Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/agents/*` | WebSocket upgrade for DO agents |
| `/api/health` | Health check |
| `/api/shade/*` | Shade order management |
| `/api/suiami/verify` | SUIAMI proof verification (GraphQL-backed) |
| `/api/timestream/:groupId/:action` | Thunder transport — Seal-encrypted message DO (`send`/`fetch`/`fetch-one`/`update`/`delete`/`add-participant`) |
| `/api/thunder/chronicom` | Per-wallet signal count cache |
| `/api/tradeport/listing/:label` | Tradeport listing proxy |
